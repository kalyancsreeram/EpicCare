               Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with non pharmacologically depressed conscious state, particularly those with acute neurological disorders and brain injuries, are at risk of seizures, often without overt clinical manifestations. Electrographic or EEG-only seizures (ESz) and electroclinical seizures (ECSz) are more prevalent in ICU patients who have prior clinical seizures (acute symptomatic or epilepsy related), infective and autoimmune encephalitis, stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. Seizures are theoretically an indicator of cerebral cortical injury in neurological and cranial insults and may impact adversely on neurological outcome, over and above that of the underlying neurological disorder. Additionally, affected patients may benefit from treatment with antiseizure medication (ASM). In some patients, electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) is the cause of their altered consciousness and prompt treatment with ASM reverses the coma. Conversely, episodic nonepileptic movements and autonomic changes in ICU patients are commonly misinterpreted and unnecessarily treated as seizures, prolonging ICU stay and impacting adversely on outcome. EEG with video is essential for accurate diagnosis of seizures and nonepileptic phenomena and is the only way ESz and ESE can be identified. Video-EEG recordings of relatively brief duration, herein referred to as routine EEG, are often sufficient to answer clinical questions, including diagnosis of ESE and identifying those patients at risk of ESz. However, if the clinical episodes are not recorded, or if clinical and EEG risk factors indicate a high likelihood of infrequent ESz or intermittent ESE, then longer duration (continuous) EEG with video, herein referred to as continuous electroencephalography (cEEG), is required for diagnosis. Additionally, if ESz are discovered, cEEG may help determine seizure burden, monitor disease progress, and allow assessment of response to therapy. Other potential applications of cEEG include monitoring for vasospasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage and ensuring maintenance of burst suppression during pharmacological management of raised intracranial pressure and ESE cEEG is not utilised routinely in ICUs in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), unlike in North America and many centres in Europe.1 The availability of inpatient EEG services varies around our countries, particularly between city and rural, and paediatric and adult hospitals. Impediments to cEEG in ANZ include the following: it is a resource- and time-intensive investigation, well-trained staff members to perform and interpret cEEG in a timely fashion are few, the clinical significance of some cEEG findings remains uncertain, the cost-effectiveness of cEEG and treatment of ESz remains to be demonstrated, and specific financial reimbursement is lacking. This critical review and position statement attempts to (i) summarise the evidence for, practicalities of, and controversies in cEEG for detection of ESz and ESE in ICU patients with depressed conscious state and (ii) provide recommendations for clinical practice, research, and reimbursement of cEEG in ANZ ICUs.

               cEEG in the neonatal ICU Seizure burden in neurologically sick neonates is higher than at any other time in life, with neonatal seizures occurring in 1e4/1000 live births.17e20 Evidence suggests that seizures contribute to secondary brain injury in neonates, especially in neonates with HIE.21e27 Delay in recognition and treatment of seizures in neonates is associated with poorer response to treatment and poorer outcomes.28,29 Neonatal seizures are challenging to manage as many paroxysmal phenomena mimic seizures, neonatal seizures have variable and subtle clinical manifestations, and most neonatal seizures are ESz, especially in neonates with moderate to severe HIE30e36 and those on ASMs. Even experienced neonatologists and neurologists are unreliable at distinguishing seizures and nonepileptic movements at the bedside. Studies indicate that 20e46% of neonates receiving ASM for seizures identified on clinical assessment do not have ESz on cEEG, exposing them to the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects of ASM. Conversely, underrecognition and undertreatment of neonatal seizures, including ESE, is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes.21,22,44e54 Amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) is used frequently in neonatal ICUs (NICUs), aEEG background being a useful indicator of neurological prognosis, especially in term and near-term infants. However, aEEG has low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ESz, especially ESz of low amplitude, brief duration, and occurring at a distance from the 2e4 recording electrodes.55e59 An RCT performed in Australian NICUs, randomising encephalopathic term or near-term neonates to management of aEEG detected plus clinical seizures versus management of clinical seizures only, found no difference in mortality or severe neurological morbidity at age 2 years.60 Limitations of the trial may be that aEEG was not commenced early enough in some infants, aEEG findings are not necessarily influencing ASM dosing and timing, and aEEG has a low sensitivity and specificity for detection of neonatal seizures.61,62 Nevertheless, the trial highlighted the possibility that potentially neurotoxic GABAergic ASM like phenobarbitone and midazolam mitigated the potential benefits from reduced seizure.
